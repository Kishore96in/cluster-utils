To use these, add lines like the following to your bashrc:
```
source ~/.software/kishore_cluster_utils/bash/config.sh
```
`config.sh` contains variables that need to be modified for a particular cluster (depending on, e.g, the scheduler used). The other files should require no modification.

Currently tested with PBS.
